## Mission

Debug Freifunk wifi nodes with the popular
[Wifi Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer)
app - and get the human readably node names displayed, instead of their MAC
addresses.

## How

Wifi Analyzer has an "Alias" feature, which can import a list of aliases from
a file `WifiAnalyzer_Alias.txt` from your phone's SD storage.

This app will generate such an alias file in the correct location, so you
can import it: open Wifi Analyzer and do Settings > Manage aliases > Import.
